### Sideloading (No Jailbreak)

1. (Option 1) Download the IPA file from here and sideload using your preferred method.

    The following IPA files have deleted the `Plugins` folder and include some fixes to avoid WhatsApp crashing when not signed with the proper entitlements.
    | Application | Bundle | Version | Watusi 3 | Stalky | OnlineNotify |
